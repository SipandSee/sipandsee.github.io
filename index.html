								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In a nutshell, we are a health and wellness company and THE LEADING “Gut Health” company!! We want to see people improve their quality of life by improving their health from the inside out. We prefer to place a laser focus on root causes of the issues and avoid BANDAID solutions. We also keep it so SIMPLE  
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>1.</strong> We are a HEALTH company....and sometimes getting healthy means losing weight! But, it is SO much more than that. We are not a meal replacement company... (although we have a stellar, plant based meal replacement shake). We primarily offer a super yummy pink drink for blood sugar and hormone balance, Probiotics, Vitamins, natural pain relief, and even plant based omegas (all extremely high quality, purely sourced, plant-based) to help you achieve all types of health goals!
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>2.</strong> Our products are natural, plant-based, caffeine free, non-GMO, contain no artificial sweeteners/dyes/flavors, and many of our products are vegan. Most doctors will back and encourage the use of Plexus products. However, if you have any medical conditions you are concerned about, please check with your doctor just to be on the safe side.
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>3.</strong> Our products are designed to promote health and wellness within the body. The primary benefit is not weight loss. That is just a side benefit to a healthier body and proper functioning of systems! It is literally MIND BLOWING the number of different testimonies we have from ALL the different things Plexus has helped!</p>
